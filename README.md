---Please Note: even though I uploaded this 6/28, this is from my earlier days in programming and the code probably shows that. I have improved since this was written.

A healthbar project i started in my first year programming and ended up taking a bit farther.
There are 4 'worlds' and in each world the has many levels.
The base of the game (also world 1) is the player (Goku - in world 1 he is placed on king kai's planet) is being chased by a villain (world 1 this would be buu) and has to collect senzu beans. Senzu beans replenish Goku's health as well as give him expereince which levels him up. 
As goku levels, he as well as buu get faster until a certain point, at that point the payler can choose to move on to the next world, or play indefinitely in the current one - no more speed changes to Goku or the villain though.

The game also consists of redbull which give speed boosts to Goku, and a 'cheat' on world 1 where once a level pressing T will teleport goku to a senzu bean.

World 2's difference is that the game is split screen, the player controls 1 Goku and there is a mirroring goku on the other side, the villain chases one of the goku's at random.
Each screen is a different world, the left being goku in super saiyan 1 on planet namek and the right being like the first world, goku being super saiyan 3 on king kai's planet. When the villain is in the left side, he is freiza, on the right he is buu (context of the show)

world 3 is like world 2 with two villains

world 4 is like world 2 but instead of the other goku mirroring the first goku, the player has to choose between one goku to control at a time (switching using the 'C' key) and has a time limit to get a senzu bean or he will recieve a significant amount of damage.
